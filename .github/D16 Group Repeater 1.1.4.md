- Choose the right delay model for your source. D16 Group Repeater 1.1.4 offers 23 different delay models that can suit different types of sounds and genres. For example, you can use the Tape model for a warm and organic sound, the Digital model for a clean and precise sound, or the Space Echo model for a dubby and psychedelic sound.
- Adjust the delay time and feedback to create the desired rhythm and depth. You can sync the delay time to your host tempo or set it manually with the knob or the tap button. You can also use the offset knob to create a slight difference between the left and right channels for a stereo effect. The feedback knob controls how much of the delayed signal is fed back into the input, creating more repetitions and longer tails.
- Use the modulation section to add some movement and character to your delays. You can choose from three types of modulation: sine, triangle, or random. You can also adjust the rate and depth of the modulation to create subtle variations or dramatic pitch shifts.
- Use the saturation section to add some warmth and distortion to your delays. You can choose from three types of saturation: tube, tape, or lo-fi. You can also adjust the drive and tone of the saturation to create different flavors of distortion.
- Use the filter section to shape the tone of your delays. You can choose from three types of filters: low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass. You can also adjust the cutoff and resonance of the filter to create different effects such as darkening, brightening, or resonating your delays.
- Use the ducking section to control the level of your delays according to the input signal. You can adjust the threshold and ratio of the ducking to create different effects such as reducing the delays when the input is loud or increasing them when the input is quiet.
- Use the mix section to balance the level of your dry and wet signals. You can also use the width knob to adjust the stereo image of your wet signal from mono to wide.

D16 Group Repeater 1.1.4 is a powerful and versatile delay plugin that can help you create amazing delay effects in your projects. You can experiment with different settings and combinations to find your own sound and style.
