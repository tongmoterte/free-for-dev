# EKLH25 FONT 78: A Mystery or a Mistake?
 
EKLH25 FONT 78 is a string of letters and numbers that has no apparent meaning or connection to any font. It appears on a few websites, such as [Sway](https://sway.office.com/pecI7CTAuRDxU1LL) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/pauliwiviq/eklh25-font-78), but without any explanation or context. Is it a code, a name, or a mistake?
 
One possible way to find out more about EKLH25 FONT 78 is to use a font finder tool, such as [WhatTheFont](https://www.myfonts.com/pages/whatthefont) or [What Font Is](https://www.whatfontis.com/). These tools can help you identify fonts from images or text by comparing them to their database of fonts. However, when we tried to use these tools to find EKLH25 FONT 78, we got no results. This suggests that EKLH25 FONT 78 is not a font at all, but rather a random string of characters.

## What is a font and how to find one?
 
A font is a set of characters that share a common design and style. Fonts are used to create text for various purposes, such as writing, printing, or displaying on a screen. Fonts can vary in size, shape, color, and appearance. Some fonts are more suitable for certain contexts than others. For example, a font that is easy to read on a book may not be easy to read on a website.

There are many fonts available on the web, and you can also create your own fonts using software or online tools. However, sometimes you may encounter a font that you like but do not know its name or where to find it. In that case, you can use a font finder tool to help you identify the font. A font finder tool can analyze an image or text that contains the font and compare it to its database of fonts. It can then show you the best matches and give you information about the font, such as its name, category, designer, and license.
 
Some of the most popular font finder tools are WhatTheFont and What Font Is. They are both free and easy to use. You just need to upload an image of the font or enter some text that uses the font. The tool will then scan the image or text and show you the possible fonts that match it. You can also enter your own text and adjust the font size to see how the font looks like as text.
 
Using a font finder tool can help you discover new fonts or find fonts that you already like. You can also use a font finder tool to learn more about fonts and their history, design, and usage. Fonts are an important part of communication and expression, and finding the right font can make a difference in your message.
