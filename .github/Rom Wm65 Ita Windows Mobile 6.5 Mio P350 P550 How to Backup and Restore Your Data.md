- If your device does not boot into the bootloader mode, make sure you have pressed and held the power button and the reset button at the same time. You may need to try several times until you see the blue screen.
- If your device does not recognize the SD card or the files on it, make sure you have formatted the SD card as FAT32 and copied the files to the root of the card. You may need to use a different SD card or a card reader to do this.
- If your device freezes or crashes during or after the installation, you may need to hard reset your device by pressing and holding the power button and the reset button at the same time for 10 seconds. This will erase all your data and settings, so make sure you have backed them up before doing this.
- If your device does not work properly after the installation, you may need to tweak some settings or install some drivers or applications to make it compatible with Windows Mobile 6.5.
