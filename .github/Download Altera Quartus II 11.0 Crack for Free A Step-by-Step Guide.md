Quartus II 11.0 is the latest version of the software that was released in 2011 and has improved performance and functionality over previous versions. According to Altera, Quartus II 11.0 has a three-fold advantage in compilation time over its high-end 65-nm competitors. It also enhances performance and productivity, allowing designers to shorten compilation time and meet performance requirements.
  
Quartus II 11.0 is available in three editions: Web Edition, Subscription Edition, and Programmer Edition. The Web Edition is a free version that supports a limited number of devices and features. The Subscription Edition is a paid version that supports all devices and features and includes technical support and software updates. The Programmer Edition is a standalone version that only supports device programming and configuration.
  
Quartus II 11.0 can be downloaded from the Intel FPGA Software Download Center[^1^]. Users need to register and request a license file from the Self Service Licensing Center[^2^]. Users can also find documentation, tutorials, training courses, and support resources on the Intel FPGA website[^3^].

Quartus II 11.0 can be used to design various FPGA applications, such as random number generators, digital signal processing, image processing, encryption, and more. Some of these design examples are available on the Intel FPGA website[^4^] and other online resources[^5^] . These examples can help FPGA designers to learn the best practices, techniques, and methodologies for FPGA design using Quartus II 11.0.

Quartus II 11.0 also supports various programming languages and standards, such as Verilog, VHDL, SystemVerilog, OpenCL, and IP-XACT. These languages and standards allow FPGA designers to express their designs at different levels of abstraction and reuse existing code and IP cores. Quartus II 11.0 also provides various tools and features to help FPGA designers to debug, optimize, and verify their designs.

One of the key features of Quartus II 11.0 is the support for new device families and modes. Quartus II 11.0 provides final timing models and FPGA configuration file support for all Cyclone IV GX FPGAs[^1^]. These FPGAs are low-cost and low-power devices that offer up to 150K logic elements, 6.5 Mbits of embedded memory, and up to eight integrated transceivers operating at up to 3.125 Gbps[^2^]. Quartus II 11.0 also offers support for expanded transceiver modes for Stratix V FPGAs[^3^]. These FPGAs are high-performance and high-bandwidth devices that offer up to 950K logic elements, 53 Mbits of embedded memory, and up to 66 integrated transceivers operating at up to 14.1 Gbps.
  
Another feature of Quartus II 11.0 is the enhanced Chip Planner tool. The Chip Planner tool allows FPGA designers to view and edit their designs at the physical level, such as placing and routing logic elements, pins, and transceivers. The Chip Planner tool in Quartus II 11.0 provides improved usability when designing with Stratix V FPGA transceivers[^1^]. It also supports incremental compilation flow, which allows designers to preserve previous placement and routing results and only recompile the modified portions of their designs. This can significantly reduce compilation time and improve design performance.
